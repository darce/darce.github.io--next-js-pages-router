From January 2021 to February 2022, I was part of the Research and Development team, where our primary goal was to identify and develop features beyond the existing production timeline. In collaboration with the Chief Architect and the product team, I contributed to the prototyping of a Workflow Automation Interface and Image Blur Detection. My role also involved engaging in cross-team discussions to influence the development of new features and product requirements. During this period, I was instrumental in prototyping these new features using technologies such as PolymerLit, React.js, and the Javascript implementation of OpenCV, all aimed at integrating with our current product offerings.

Earlier, from September 2018 to January 2021, I served on the Production team, where I spearheaded an initiative to align our codebase with contemporary Accessibility standards. A significant accomplishment was implementing a Javascript library to facilitate keyboard navigation within our main B2B product. This implementation was rolled out across our applications, significantly reducing our Accessibility Tech Debt. My contributions also extended to the development of the forthcoming version of our app using React.js. I worked in close collaboration with product owners and UX designers to introduce new features, and I was responsible for creating web components utilizing Polymer and Redux. Furthermore, I implemented unit tests using Mocha and Chai and took on the role of mentoring new developers in our front-end technology stack.
