I was approached to redesign Barbara Beirne&apos;s photography showcase. 
She was a New York photographer prolific during the 1980s. Most of her archives were encapsulated in a legacy Flash website. 
The image assets had to be extracted from the binary .swf files (this process is called “decompiling”). 

Future compatibility was a concern, so we decided to create a full-screen image carousel in Vanilla JavaScript.
