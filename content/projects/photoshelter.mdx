## Research and Development
Our primary goal of the R&D Department at Photoshelter was to explore and prototype features outside the existing production timeline, ensuring our products remained innovative and competitive.
Working closely with the Chief Architect, we identified critical areas for improvement and innovation. 
My role was central in prototyping these new features using technologies including PolymerLit, React.js, and the Javascript implementation of OpenCV.

*Key Achievements:*
- **Workflow Automation Interface**: 
The Workflow Automation Interface I prototyped at the R&D department accelerated the development of this feature by the production team. 
This was one of the features our customers requested the most. 
The prototype I built laid the groundwork for the production team to implement this feature, reducing production time by 30% compared to building the feature in the production environment.

- **Image Blur Comparison Tool**: Built with the client-side implementation of OpenCV. Although this prototype ultimately did not make it into production, it served as an example of client-side image manipulation tools that do not require backend development time or server-side resources beyond static files.

## Production Team Initiatives
The main objective was to align our codebase with contemporary Accessibility standards, significantly reducing the Tech Debt from our legacy codebase.

*Key Achievements:*
- **Create a roadmap to achieve Accessibility**: 
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Implemented a Javascript library keyboard navigation within our main B2B product, significantly reducing our Accessibility Tech Debt and ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards.
