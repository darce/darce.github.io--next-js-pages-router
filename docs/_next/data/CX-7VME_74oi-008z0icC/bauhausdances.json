It was important for the site not to have an “out-of-the-box” feel, so a custom wordpress theme was developed. The new identity is based on three concentric rings on the top right corner, which was derived from a still image of a dancer holding hoops against a dark background. These rings are mapped to the user‘s movements, and are subtly animated to follow the cursor."},"__N_SSG":true}
