This collaboration involved transforming static designs into responsive, pixel-perfect code, ensuring high-quality online presentations. A notable achievement was prototyping and developing the Marketing Department's first direct mail, which utilized CSS3 animations to enhance user engagement and visual appeal. Additionally, I authored automation tools for direct mail campaigns. These tools were built using a combination of Node.js, bash script, and Gulp, streamlining the process and improving the efficiency of our marketing efforts. My contributions in these areas were key to enhancing the digital presence and marketing initiatives of the company."},{"slug":"barbarabearnie","frontMatter":{"index":20,"year":2023,"title":"barbarabearnie.com","subtitle":"Portfolio design and development","description":"Extracting a porfolio from a legacy Flash website","details":"...","links":[{"url":"barbarabearnie.com","label":"Barbara Bearnie portfolio"}],"images":[],"tags":["front-end","javascript"]},"content":"I was approached to redesign Barbara Beirne&apos;s photography showcase. She was a New York photographer prolific during the 1980s. Most of her archives were encapsulated in a legacy Flash website. The image assets had to be extracted from the binary .swf files (this process is called “decompiling”). \n\nFuture compatibility was a concern, so we decided to create a full-screen image carousel in Vanilla JavaScript.\n"},{"slug":"bauhausdances","frontMatter":{"index":30,"year":2023,"title":"bauhausdances.org","subtitle":"Redesign and site development","description":"Brand identity and custom wordpress theme","details":"","links":[{"url":"http://bauhausdances.org","label":"Bauhaus Dances"}],"images":[],"tags":["front-end","wordpress","custom-theme"]},"content":"Filmmaker Debra McCall needed a CMS to host and promote her 1982 film recreating Oskar Schlemmer's Bauhaus Dances. It was important for the site not to have an “out-of-the-box” feel, so a custom wordpress theme was developed. The new identity is based on three concentric rings on the top right corner, which was derived from a still image of a dancer holding hoops against a dark background. These rings are mapped to the user‘s movements, and are subtly animated to follow the cursor."},{"slug":"msnbc","frontMatter":{"index":50,"year":2023,"title":"msnbc.com/videos","subtitle":"Prototyping and Front-End Development","description":"Online Video Channel Developed at NBC in Consultation with Lullabot.com","details":"Writeup...","links":[{"url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20180101231024/https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/","label":"iPhone X website archive"}],"images":[],"tags":["front-end","wordpress","custom-theme"]},"content":"In 2016, I developed the initial prototype for the new online video section of MSNBC. My main task was in iterating through various working interface protypes, suggesting and implementing UI features. I was involved in the entire life cycle of the site, from ideation to launch.\n\nThe driving concept for the interface was continuous video consumption, while exposing community engagement features and related news stories.\n"},{"slug":"photoshelter","frontMatter":{"index":10,"year":2021,"title":"photoshelter.com","subtitle":"Enterprise SaaS development","description":"Front-end development, Interface implementation","details":"Writeup...","links":[{"url":"http://www.photoshelter.com","label":"Photoshelter.com"}],"images":[],"tags":["front-end","react","web-components"]},"content":"From January 2021 to February 2022, I was part of the Research and Development team, where our primary goal was to identify and develop features beyond the existing production timeline. In collaboration with the Chief Architect and the product team, I contributed to the prototyping of a Workflow Automation Interface and Image Blur Detection. My role also involved engaging in cross-team discussions to influence the development of new features and product requirements. During this period, I was instrumental in prototyping these new features using technologies such as PolymerLit, React.js, and the Javascript implementation of OpenCV, all aimed at integrating with our current product offerings.\n\nEarlier, from September 2018 to January 2021, I served on the Production team, where I spearheaded an initiative to align our codebase with contemporary Accessibility standards. A significant accomplishment was implementing a Javascript library to facilitate keyboard navigation within our main B2B product. This implementation was rolled out across our applications, significantly reducing our Accessibility Tech Debt. My contributions also extended to the development of the forthcoming version of our app using React.js. I worked in close collaboration with product owners and UX designers to introduce new features, and I was responsible for creating web components utilizing Polymer and Redux. Furthermore, I implemented unit tests using Mocha and Chai and took on the role of mentoring new developers in our front-end technology stack."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
